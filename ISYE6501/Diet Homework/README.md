# Diet Optimization (Linear Programming)

Using PuLP we were asked to solve a diet minimization problem.

The provided data set gave different foods, their price per serving, and their corresponding nutrional information. The first part of the problem was to solve the problem focusing on minimizing the cost and meeting the minimum and maximum constraints of all nutrients. The second part of the problem added three extra constraints to the initial problem: if a food was chosen then at least 1/10 of the serving must be used in the diet, only broccoli or celery could be chosen (not both), and at least 3 kinds of meat/poultry/fish/eggs must be used in the solution.

Lastly, we were provided a large diet data set with over 6000 types of food, and the corresponding information for 30 nutrients. Instead of minimizing the cost of the diet, for this data set were minimizing the cholesterol of the diet.
