# ISYE 6501 - Introduction to Analytical Modeling

This course gives a basic introduction to a wide variety of analytics models and techniques, including the
basic ideas behind the models, experience using software to solve/analyze them, and case studies
dealing with combining models to find a complete solution. Modeling approaches covered include
classification, clustering, change detection, time series modeling, regression models, design of
experiments, probability distributions, probability-based models and simulation, PCA, and optimization.
Cross-cutting topics like data preparation, model validation, and variable selection are also covered.
