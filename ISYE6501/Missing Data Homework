# Missing Data (Different Imputation Methods)

For this assignment we were asked to impute missing values for the data set using a variety of methods, create a regression model using the imputed data, and compare the accuracy/quality of the models created from different imputation methods.

The models were created using the following imputation methods:
1) Mean
2) Mode
3) Regression
4) Regression with Perturbation 
5) Original Data Set (no changeS)
6) Original Data Set with an added binary variable to indicate missing data

I created Support Vector Models using the different data sets with an 80% training and 20% testing split.
